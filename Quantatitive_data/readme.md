### Quantitative Data Overview:
The `Quantitative_data` directory presents the targeted repositories, the collected commits, and the filtered commits after the Crosscheck in the GitHub impersonation study.

- **repolist.tar.xz**:  
  Contains the targeted repositories collected in the study, gathered via the `getrepo.py` script.

Due to limitations on uploading large files to GitHub, all collected commits and the Crosscheck results are available via a Dropbox link using an anonymously named account.
