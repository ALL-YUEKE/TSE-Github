# ICSE25_github
The repository for submission ICSE 2025 

### For the Quantitative Analysis Section:
- **Quantitative_script**:  
  Contains scripts for scraping data from GitHub using the GitHub API and for analyzing this data.
  
- **Quantitative_data**:  
  Includes data from the execution of scripts, covering all targeted repositories, all commits from those repositories and their contributors, and information on GitHub users involved in multi-email commits identified by Crosscheck. Due to limitations on file uploads on GitHub, we have provided an anonymous Dropbox link for data sharing. Although this data is publicly accessible through the GitHub API, we have anonymized personal information such as User IDs, emails, and commit SHA values.

### For the Interview Section:
- **Interview Script.pdf**:  
  This is the interview script used for questioning all participants, except for participant S17.
  
- **Codebook.csv**:
  Compiles responses from participants to the interview questions. Note that S17, who has prior experience at GitHub and is familiar with impersonation behaviors, was not asked the standard interview questions.
