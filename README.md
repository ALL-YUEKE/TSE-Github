- **Quantitative_data**:  
  Includes data from the execution of scripts, covering all targeted repositories, all commits from those repositories and their contributors, and information on GitHub users involved in multi-email commits identified by Crosscheck.Although this data is publicly accessible through the GitHub API, we have anonymized personal information such as User IDs, emails, and commit SHA values.

  This is the interview script used for questioning all participants, except for participant S17.
